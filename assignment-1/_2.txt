Packet Switching:
1. Packet-switching means that bits of information can take virtually any route and still end up at its final destination.
2. Packet switching is most commonly seen on data networks, including LANs, WANs and the Internet. 
3. It is well suited to data transmission, as it allows networks to adapt to changing conditions quickly. For example, if one of the network's routers fails, packets can be automatically re-routed to avoid that device.
