MIME:
1.  MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension.
2.  It is a standard that was proposed by Bell Communications in 1991 in order to expand the limited capabilities of email. 
3.  Examples for MIME types: text/html,text/plain,application/pdf,image/jpeg,image/png,image/gif
4.  Reason why MIME type specification is necessary:
    a.  Content Interpretation: It specifies the type of data or comtent send between the server and browser.
        This information is crucial because it allows the browser to interpret and display the content correctly.
    b.  Security: MIME types help ensure security by preventing browsers from executing or displaying potentially harmful content in unintended ways.
    c.  Data Validation: MIME types help ensure data validation and integrity. The browser can verify that the received data matches the expected MIME type, preventing issues where, for example, a user uploads a malicious file with an incorrect MIME type.
